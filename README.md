# CONTINUOUS-AUTHENTICATION
Adaptive and continuous framework for mobile users.The proposed framework based on the dataset which consists of the sensor data of all the three sensors(gyroscope,accelerometer,magnetometer). Seven activities which were discussedfor our study are Biking, walking upstairs, and downstairs, sitting and standing, etc. were used to differentiate among different users.Four basic time-domain features which are mean, median, variance, and standard deviation extracted from each sample window. Random Forest and Light Gradient Boosting Classifiersare used as a classifier to classify this dataset. We tried to show that with fewer features also we can get good accuracy.Random forest achieved good accuracy while sitting and standing of the user whereas LGB achieved 98.18 % accuracy. Classifiers RF and LGB perform well in both cases with and without RFE. It also tells that what are the ideal positions which can give better recognition result.
